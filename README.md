WTF is the 1033 Program?

[From Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1033_program), natch:

The 1033 Program was created by the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 1997 as part of the US Government's Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services (DLA) to transfer excess military equipment to law enforcement agencies. As of 2014, 8,000 local law enforcement agencies participated in the reutilization program that has transferred $5.1 billion in military hardware from the Department of Defense to local American law enforcement agencies since 1997.[1] According to DLA material worth $449 million was transferred in 2013 alone. The most commonly obtained item from the 1033 program is ammunition. Some of the other most commonly requested items include cold weather clothing, sand bags, medical supplies, sleeping bags, flashlights and electrical wiring. Grenade launchers and vehicles such as aircraft, watercraft and armored vehicles have also been obtained.
